* The "Checkout Times by Gender" image shows that gender doesn't really affect trip duration, with the peaks still being at approximately 10 minutes. The main difference is just that there were less female and unknown riders. (https://github.com/awolfe95/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_TImes_by_Gender.png)

* The "Trips by Weekday per Hour" image shows that weekdays have a clear trend of morning and evening rides being most popular, probably due to commute times. Saturdays are the most popular weekend days, but both Saturday and Sunday have popular hours starting around 10 am and lasting to early evening.

## Summary

### Overall, the most popular times for bikesharing services center around the workday, with males riding more bikes than females. One additional visualization could be examining the number of rides by days of the week and by age to see if people of different ages tend to prefer riding on different days or at different times. Another visualization could be examining the difference between start locations during the weekdays versus on the weekends, to see if start locations during the weekdays correlate to where people work, whereas on the weekends if it is more often parks, etc.
